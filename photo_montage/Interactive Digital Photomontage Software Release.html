<body bgcolor="white">

From this page you can download the executable and source code to our
research project, <a href="http://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/photomontage/">
Interactive Digital Photomontage</a>.  If you simply wish to use our
software, just download the Windows executable.  If you would like to
extend our approach, our source code is also available for research
purposes.  The source code is released under the terms of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU Public License</a>. <p>

</p><p><b><font color="#ff0000">This is research software and code, and
thus very messy and poorly-documented.  It is likely to contain bugs.
We do not promise that it works, and we do not promise to support it.
Use at your own risk!  </font></b></p><p>

<font size="+1"><b>Executable &amp; Documentation</b></font><br></p><p>

You may download the executable <a href="http://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/photomontage/release/fuse.exe">here</a>.  There is
also some basic <a href="http://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/photomontage/release/photodocs/index.html">documentation</a>.  Sample <a href="http://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/photomontage/">data sets</a> are available. </p><p>

Notice that our system requires some sort of hardware-accelerated openGL. Don't worry, you likely have this.</p><p>

<font size="+1"><b>Source Code</b></font></p><p>

Our system uses the open-source GUI toolkit <a href="http://www.wxwindows.org/">WxWidgets</a>; as such, it can be
compiled on Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X.  However, we have only
compiled it on Windows and Linux. </p><p>

Also, we use graph cut software developed by <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~vnk/">Vladimir Kolmogorov</a>.
His source code is available publicly, but has not been released under
the terms of the GPL; we thus ask you to download it separately. </p><p>

The first three steps are the same for Windows or Linux. </p><p>

</p><ol>
<li>Download <a href="http://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/photomontage/release/fuse_1b.zip">source code</a> and unzip it.</li>

<li>Download graph cut software <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/People/vnk/software/match-v3.1.src.tar.gz">here</a>.
Copy the following files from match-v3.1.src/maxflow/ to
fuse/graphcuts/: block.h, graph.h, graph.cpp, maxflow.cpp.</li>

<li>In line 102 of fuse/graphcuts/graph.h, change "short" to "float".
In line 104, change "int" to "double". </li><br>

</ol>

<b>Windows</b><p>

</p><ol>
<li>Download and install <a href="http://www.wxwindows.org/">WxWidgets</a> version 2.4.2.  Make
sure to enable openGL support by setting wxUSE_GLCANVAS to 1 in
setup.h.</li>

<li>Set the WXWIN environment variable to the path to your WxWidgets
installation.</li>

<li>Copy the contents of fuse/win to the top-level fuse directory.</li>

<li>Open the Visual Studio project file, and compile.</li>

</ol>


<br>

<b>Linux</b> <p>

</p><ol>

<li> Make sure you have some sort of hardware-accelerated openGL,
rather than pure software rendering.</li>

<li>Download and install <a href="http://www.wxwindows.org/">WxWidgets</a> version 2.4.2.  Make
sure to enable openGL support by passing option -with-opengl to the
Configure script.  Also, read the README in fuse/linux.</li>

<li>Copy fuse/linux/Makefile to fuse/Makefile.  (Makefile originally by <a href="http://graphics.csail.mit.edu/~sumner/">Bob Sumner</a>.)</li>

<li>Type "make".</li>

</ol>
