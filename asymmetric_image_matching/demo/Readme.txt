demo.m contain three pairs of images, each of which takes short, medium, and long match time respectively.

For evaluation, 
I used matchscore(3) of demo output, which is a matching score of two images used for caltech101,256 benchmark test. 

Demo displays matched points in color, 
in which cyan denotes gemoetrically consistent matches(highly-weighted), yellow denote medium quality, and red denotes bad quality.
